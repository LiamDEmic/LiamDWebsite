					<td><h2>PC Build For Client</h2><h3>This is a high-end desktop PC I built for my client. It consists of an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU cooled by an Arctic Liquid Freezer 3 420mm AIO liquid cooler, an AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX GPU, and 64gb of DDR5-6000 RAM with a CAS latency of 30. It is intended for high-end 4K gaming and 3D rendering. My client chose the components under my advisement, and I helped them put together the PC. I also set up their dual 4K monitors used for productivity.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>Home Network Renovation</h2><h3>This is an internet network I set up for the household of my family. The goal was to create a high-end home network while still being out-of-sight from others. The modem is provided by the ISP. The router is a mini-ITX desktop I built, using an Intel Celeron G6900, 4gb of RAM, and a 1GBPS NIC, powered by a Pico-PSU to ensure low power draw. It runs OPNSense, a free and open-source router OS that is updated frequently and reliable. The network switch is a TP-Link 5-port network switch with PoE support, which was especially useful for the Wireless Access Point. The Wireless Access Point is a TP-Link EAP650, which is powerful enough to fill the entire house (with the exception of the attic, which is only used for storage) with WiFi when placed in the center of the basement. Strategic placement of all these devices created an internet network that is fast, stable, plentiful, and reliable.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>PC Build For Client</h2><h3>This is a mid-range desktop PC I built for my client. It started off with an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 cpu cooled by it's stock cooler, 16GB of DDR4-3200 RAM with a CAS latency of 16, and an Nvidia GeForce GT 730 GPU. The client wanted the build to cost $500, and at the time of building, PC components (namely GPUs) were expensive, hence the low specs. A few years later, my client did buy a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, and I replaced the GPU for them. The build is intended for streaming video game consoles, but eventually wanted to do 1080p gaming, hence the eventual GPU upgrade. I also helped my client set up their streaming setup, ensuring an environment that is both ergonomic and spacious.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>PlayStation 4 Console Repair For Client</h2><h3>A client wanted me to repair their PlayStation 4 console. They were having issues with the functionality of the optical disk drive, and knew of my experience in hardware repair. I disassembled the console using a security torx screwdriver, and dusted off the internals with compressed air while I was troubleshooting the issue. I got to the optical disk drive, disassembled it, cleaned off some components with isopropyl alcohol, and reassembled the disk drive. After giving the optical disk drive the proper care it needed, I reassembled the console, and powered it on. Using a Blu-Ray disc, I verified the functionality of the disk drive, confirming a successful repair and a joyous client.</h3></td>

					<td><h2>NYC Department of Social Services</h2><h3>At this internship, I managed and organized printer data, such as IP addresses and print counts, from brands including Xerox, Nuevera and Konica. I used Excel, the web interfaces of these printers, and the Windows command line to keep printers essential for business up and running. I also reinstalled MacOS on a Mac Pro desktop by creating and using a bootable USB drive via disk manager and the MacOS terminal.</h3></td>

Here, I participated in digital security audit meetings to ensure the digital security of potential applicants. These meetings went over clients with their proposed technology for Mount Sinai, and what data the devices would require to function. These meetings would help us decide if Mount Sinai should use certain clients for equipment needs, keeping patients and their data safe and secure.</h3></td>

I wrote transcripts for podcasts made by Autism Grown Up using Google Docs, typing up accurate and legible subtitles to help those hard of hearing enjoy the podcasts. I created thumbnails for podcasts made by Autism Grown Up to be posted on YouTube using Canva, making thumbnails consistent with their branding. I even edited podcasts made by Autism Grown Up to be uploaded on YouTube by using Vegas Pro Edit, making the podcasts fit in a format suitable for the video-sharing platform.</h3></td>
